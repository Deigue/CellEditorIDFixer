# Cell Editor ID Fixer

Skyrim SE Mutagen Patcher to fix CELL Editor IDs containing underscores in them.

---

> Note: A workaround has been implemented in order to support overriding Editor IDs for
Worldspace cells. As of now, some additional searching is required to find the correct information for the Worldspace under which the Cells that are to be patched reside in. This
will mean the patcher requires a bit longer to complete.
